The run_analysis.R will perform the following:

- Combine the test and train data sets
- Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measurement
- Calcuate the mean of each measurement for each subject and each activity
- Create a tidy data set that has one mean value for each measurement, activity and subject

A description of the measured variables is shown in codebook.md.
