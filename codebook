Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FFTBodyAcc-XYZ, FFTBodyAccJerk-XYZ, FFTBodyGyro-XYZ, FFTBodyAccJerkMag, FFTBodyGyroMag, FFTBodyGyroJerkMag.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
energy: Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
angle: Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

timeBodyAccMean
timeBodyAccJerkMean
timeBodyGyroMean
